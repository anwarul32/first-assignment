        <h1>Vission</h1>
        <p>
          More and more companies are now relying upon robots, especially in the
          manufacturing industry. But, those robots that come with the
          vision-guidance turn out to be extra useful. Thanks to computer
          vision, robots can help businesses with anticipating the aging
          workforce and growing labor expenses while enhancing automated
          processes.
